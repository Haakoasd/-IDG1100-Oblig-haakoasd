1. What components are part of the Von Neuman Architecture

    The following components are part of the Von Neuman Architecture:

    A processing unit that contains an arithmetic logic unit and processor registers.
    A control unit that contains an instruction register and program counter.
    Memory that stores data and intructions.
    External mass storage.
    Input and output mechanisms.


2. What is user space?

    The user space(also called userland) refers to all code that runs outside the operating systems kernel. The user space is basically
    system memory allocated to running applications, while the kernel space is memory allocated to the kernel and the OS. 

3. What is the shell?

    The shell is a tool for manipulating data and executing several applications under certain conditions. You can access a shell from a
    command line (CLI) or using graphical user interface (GUI). If you are operating with a CLI it require the user to be familiar with 
    commands and their calling syntax. If you are using a Unix-like system you have different types of shells.

4. Where is the shell located?

    The shell is located in the User Space (Userland)

5. What is the main task of the shell?

    The main task/purpose of the shell is to read commands and run other programs. One of the beggest advantages with the shell is the high
    "action-to-keystroke" ratio. By that I mean you can perform complicated tasks with simple commands.

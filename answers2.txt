    The "pwd" (print working directory) command will print the current working directory. 

12. UNIX Command: rename files (give an example)

    The "mv" command allows you to rename files. Example: mv old-file-name.txt new-file-name.txt

13. UNIX Command: schedule the execution of programs in the future

    The command "crontab -e" will create a cronjob which is used for scheduling a command or script
    to run automatically at a specified time and date.

14. UNIX Command: Forcefully shutdown the command with process ID 123

    The command "kill -9 123" is used to forcefully shutdown the command with process ID 123.

15. UNIX Command: access your root user

    The command "sudo" will access your root user.

16. Crontab scheduled: At minute 30 on Sunday.

    30 * * * 6

17. Crontab scheduled: At minute 30 on day-of-month 15.

    30 * 15 * * 

18. Crontab scheduled: At 05:30 on every day-of-week from Sunday through Monday in June.

    30 05 * 6 0-1

19. Script: print your name and date

    You can simply write date +"YOUR_NAME %d/%m%Y" to print to the consoll. If you want to do it from a script you can do the following:
    #!/bin/bash
    date=$(date)
    echo "YOUR_NAME $date"

20. Script: add two numeric values, print the result

    #!/bin/bash
    # Add two numeric values, print the result

    a=5 
    b=2

    sum=$(( $a + $b ))
    echo $sum


21. Script: inputs username, prints “USERNAME stored”

    #!/bin/bash
    #inputs username, prints “USERNAME stored”

    read -p "Enter username: " username
    echo "$username stored"

22. Script: Store the output of the command “hostname” in a variable. Display “This script is
running on _.” where “_” is the output of the “hostname” command.

    #!/bin/bash
    #Store the output of the command “hostname” in a variable. Display “This script is
    #running on _.” where “_” is the output of the “hostname” command.

    hostname=$(hostname)
    echo "This script is running on $hostname"

23. Script: Store the output of the working directory (from where the script is run) in a variable
then print the variable.

    #!/bin/bash
    #Store the output of the working directory (from where the script is run) in a variable
    #then print the variable.

    pwd=$(pwd)
    echo "The working directory is $pwd"

24. Create a step by step tutorial on how to create a cronjob that prints “Task scheduled at” +
DATE. Cronjob is scheduled every 30 minutes on today’s date (only today).

    First click on the windows key and type in cmd to open the command line. Then type in ssh username@login.stud.ntnu.no and type in your passord.
    Then type in crontab -e. For the ability to edit you need to press "i" and the type in */30 * CURRENT_DAY CURRENT_MONTH * echo "Task scheduled
    at $(date)" >> /tmp/cronEx.txt. Then hit escape, and type in semicolon and wq to exit.     

25. Create a script that takes an input (letter or number) that will display the answer of a question.
The script should when started list a menu for the user with the different questions that can be
chosen and which corresponding letter the user will have to give as input to display the answer of
the desired question. One of the possible inputs the user should be able to make is "q" for quitting
the script. The menu should also have a default case where all the items is displayed again, or no
changes is made if the user gives an invalid input. Hint: use a switch case to be able to handle the
menu. Each option in the menu should lead to an echo of the answer  

    #!/bin/bash
